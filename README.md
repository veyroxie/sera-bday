# 🎉 Seraphina Birthday Website  
*A soft, flirty, red-themed birthday surprise.*

This is a custom one-page website I built as a birthday gift for **Seraphina**
The site is designed to feel romantic, elegant, and a bit flirty

It includes:

## ✨ Features
- ❤️ **Full red-themed aesthetic**  
  Soft gradients, glowing accents, and floating hearts.

- 🎧 **Embedded Spotify track**  
  The page features this song:  
  https://open.spotify.com/track/1cQ3LIkZE68pMSnPhZWXLu  
  It’s the main “read this while listening” vibe.

- 💌 **Hidden love note**  
  Clicking the "Click for cringe" button reveals a soft message.

- 🌹 **Wifey-coded writing**  
  Text throughout the page is personalised for Seraphina.

- 🎇 **Animated floating hearts**  
  Gentle visual effect to make the page feel alive.

- 📱 **Responsive layout**  
  Looks good on desktop and mobile without breaking.
